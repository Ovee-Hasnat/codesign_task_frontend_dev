# Front-end Developer Task - COdesign

This front-end application is built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **GSAP** animations.  
This project implements a hero section carousel with smooth transitions and theme switching.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, Server Components)
- [React](https://react.dev/) (with Context API for theme switching)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (utility-first styling, dark mode support)
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) (60fps animations and carousel transitions)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (type safety)

## Assumptions & Trade-offs

- The carousel transitions are click-driven (instead of auto-play) for simplicity.
- Fixed breakpoints were used for desktop / tablet / mobile responsiveness.
- GSAP was chosen for animation â†’ smooth 60fps transitions but adds extra bundle weight.
- Lazy-loading GSAP was applied in places to reduce initial bundle size.

## Performance Notes

- Responsive images (next/image) to optimize image delivery.
- Tailwindâ€™s JIT mode ensures only used classes are shipped.

## Accessibility Notes

- Used semantic HTML elements (<header>, <section>, <nav>).
- Added ARIA labels for carousel and navigation buttons.
- Ensured color contrast adapts to dark/light mode.
- Avoided overuse of ARIA (kept it meaningful and minimal).

## If I Had More Time

- Improve Responsiveness.
- Add keyboard & swipe navigation support to the carousel.
- Improve animation configuration.
- Add unit & integration tests.
- Explore server-side rendering optimizations with Next.js for GSAP-heavy sections.
